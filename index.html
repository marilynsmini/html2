		<p>Being a wife and <a href="http://google.com">mother</a> are the best parts of my life. My husband and I have been married for almost 8 years. We are very lucky to still enjoy eachother's company and spending time together. We do things together as a family as often as we can. Our children are getting older and our oldest will be leaving for the Air Force after graduation in 2024. We know our time with all of us together is short so we make the best of the time we have.</p>

<h2><i>Our Start</i></h2>
<p>My husband and I met at work in 2011. We immediately connected and knew we needed to be together. He had 2 sons from a previous marriage and our family was instantly formed. Soon after, we welcomed our daughter in 2012 and our last son in 2014.</p>
<h2><i>About Us</i></h2>
