	<h1 style="color:red;">My Children</h1>
		
	<p>I have <b>four</b> amazing children, ranging in ages from 8 to 17. I've included some information about each of them below.</p>
		
	<h2 style="color:red;"><i>Isaac</i></h2>
<p>Somehow, Isaac just turned 17-years old. It's crazy to think that this kid was only 5 when I first came into his life. He has grown and developed so much over the years. He plans to join the Air Force after graduating high school in 2024.</p>
	<h2 style="color:red;"><i>Isaiah</i></h2>
<p>Isaiah is now 15 and is enjoying his second year of high school marching band. He has definitely inherited the musical gene that runs through my husband's family. Last night, we watched him perform with the Region Honors Band under the direction of the director that taught my husband when he was in high school.</p>
	<h2 style="color:red;"><i>Isabelle</i></h2>
<p>My Belle, our only daughter. She is feisty, bossy, and independent. She starts junior high next year and is excited to join the band like her big brother. I'm at a loss for how quickly time has flown. Unfortunately, she has also inherited my facial expressions. I'll be sure to teach her when she should, and should not, use them.</p>
	<h2 style="color:red;"><i>Isen</i></h2>
<p>The baby of the family! Isen loves to play video games and has the absolute biggest heart. He loves to play soccer and will be starting with a team in a couple of months.</p>
	<h3 style="color:red;"><i>Family</i></h3>
	<p>My husband and I have a large family and we wouldn't have it any other way. All four of our children are smart and amazing. They are so similar and so different at the same time. I don't want to rush it, but I'm excited to see who they end up being.</p>
